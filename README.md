  <summary><b> Installing Python in Visual Studio Code</b></summary>
  
  1. **Install Visual Studio Code**
     - If you don't already have Visual Studio Code, download and install it from the [official Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  2. **Install Python**
     - install in linux
       ```sh
       sudo apt install python3
       ```
     - Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can check by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
       ```sh
       python --version
       ```
      If Python is not installed, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions.
  3. **Install Python Extension in VS Code**
     - Open Visual Studio Code.
     - On the left, click on the "Extensions" icon (the square icon).
     - Search for "Python" in the search bar, and select the "Python" extension developed by Microsoft. Click "Install" to install it.
  4. **Using Python in VS Code**
     - Open your Python project or create a new one in VS Code.
     - Create a new Python file or open an existing one.
     - You can now write and run Python code directly from VS Code.
  5. **Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)**
     - It's recommended to create a virtual environment for your project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
       ```sh
       python -m venv venv
       ```
  6. **Installing Dependencies (Optional)**
     - If your project requires dependencies, you can install them using the following command in the VS Code terminal:
       ```sh
       pip install package_name
       ```
  You are now ready to start developing Python applications in Visual Studio Code. Make sure to customize this information to fit your project's needs.

  <summary><b>Installing Package with pip</b></summary>

  1. **installing package**
     - Pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to easily install and manage Python packages and dependencies.
     - To install a package, use the following command:
       ```sh
       pip install package_name
       ```
     - pip install package_name
       ```sh
       pip uninstall package_name
       ```
     - To list installed packages, use:
       ```sh
       pip list
       ```
     - To freeze the installed packages (useful for requirements files), use:
       ```sh
       pip freeze > requirements.txt
       ```
     - To display detailed information about a package, use:
       ```sh
       pip show package_name
       ```
     - To search for a specific package, use:
       ```sh
       pip search package_name
       ```

  <summary><b>Creating and activating a Virtual Environment</b></summary>

  1. **creating env**
     - It's recommended to create virtual environments to isolate your Python projects. Here's how to create and activate a virtual environment:
     - Create a virtual environment by running:
       ```sh
       python -m venv name_of_environment
       ```
  2. **Activate the virtual environment**
     - On Linux and macOS:
       ```sh
       source name_of_environment/bin/activate
       ```
     - On Windows:
       ```sh
       .\name_of_environment\Scripts\activate
       ```
  3. **To Deactive the virtual environment**
     - To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
       ```sh
       deactivate
